RECEIVING & SHIPPING TRACKER
=============================

## 1. GOAL
A program that a **shipper** can use to **scan incoming stock** and allocate it correctly into inventory (AMO / KANBAN / BO).

## 2. CONTEXT
- Daily, material arrives (breakers, connectors, etc.).
- A "Waybill" report (from Oracle) lists the expected parts.
- Shipments arrive via **TST** or **PURO**.
- Only **one person** does the receiving at a time.
- Sometimes, **partial shipments** or **missing items** occur.
- The scanner behaves like a **USB keyboard** (Code128, UPC).
- UPCs are resolved via an **Access DB** (`PART_IDENTIFIERS`) or a CSV fallback.

## 3. USER ROLES

### ADMIN
- Can do everything a shipper can do
- Add / modify / remove users
- Upload or re-upload Waybills
- Edit scans
- Consult scan summaries (by session, user, date, waybill)

### SHIPPER
- Select a palette (Waybill number)
- Scan or manually enter part numbers
- Enter quantity before each scan
- View real-time progress: scanned qty, remaining qty
- Visual feedback: inventory type, scan validity, color cues
- Mark palette as finished manually or auto-complete

## 4. PROJECT PHASES
1. **Database structure** (status: not started)
2. **App interface and scanning logic** (status: not started)
3. **BO integration and automation** (status: not started)

## 5. DATABASE STRUCTURE (UPDATED)

### Suggested Tables
- **users**: user_id, username, password_hash, role
- **part_identifiers**: part_number, upc_code, alt_code, description
- **waybill_lines**: id, waybill_number, part_number, qty_total, subinv, locator, description, item_cost, date
- **scan_sessions**: session_id, user_id, start_time, end_time, waybill_number
- **scan_events**: id, session_id, part_number, scanned_qty, timestamp, raw_scan
- **scan_summary**: id, session_id, part_number, total_scanned, expected_qty, remaining_qty, allocated_to, reception_date, user_id

These tables together:
- allow tracking of partial receptions across days,
- support detailed user-based logging,
- simplify reporting and export generation,
- eliminate the need for `waybills_active`, `waybills_finished`, and `palette_active`, which are now fully handled by `waybill_lines` + scan logic.

## 6. SCANNER & PART IDENTIFICATION
- Most barcodes are **Code128** (return part number directly)
- Some are **UPC**, resolved to part number via Access DB (`PART_IDENTIFIERS`) or fallback CSV
- Scans must be matched against the current active palette lines

## 7. WAYBILL FILE SPECIFICATION
- **Excel format**, structured as follows:
  - Row 1: ignored
  - Row 2: headers
  - Row 3+: data begins

## 8. INVENTORY LOGIC

### Mapping SUBINV ‚Üí Inventory
- `DRV-AMO` ‚Üí AMO
- `DRV-RM` ‚Üí KANBAN

### Rules:
- A part can be present in **both** AMO and KANBAN (must show how much in each)
- Unscanned lines must always be clearly visible
- Invalid scans (not in Waybill) must be flagged
- ‚úÖ A part number can be scanned multiple times (accumulated over time)
- üö´ If scanning would exceed expected QTY, the scan is blocked
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clear **visual and/or audio warning** is required when blocking over-scans
- ‚úÖ Default quantity = 1 if no value is specified
- üîÅ Quantity input resets to 1 automatically after each scan
- ü§ñ If the same part number exists on multiple lines (e.g., AMO and KANBAN), the program automatically allocates scans **prioritizing AMO first**, then KANBAN, based on remaining quantity. No user intervention required.

## 9. UI REQUIREMENTS

### For SHIPPER
- Minimal clicks
- Manual part number input allowed
- Quantity input before scanning (default = 1, resets after each scan)
- Display part info after scan
- Clear display of what goes where (AMO/KANBAN/BO)
- Warnings for invalid scans
- Mark palette done manually or automatically
- ‚úÖ Display a **progress bar per part number**, ideally using **color gradient**
  - Ex: from red (0%) to green (100%)
  - ‚úÖ Compatible with distant screen viewing

### For ADMIN
- Upload Waybill files
- View scan logs
- Manage users
- ‚úÖ Access and export scan summaries per session, user, or waybill (from `scan_summary`)

## 10. AUTHENTICATION
- Users must **log in** with a **username and password**.
- Each user session is tracked and recorded.
- The session will associate each scan to the logged-in user.

## 11. BO REPORT (TO BE IMPLEMENTED LATER)

### File Spec:
- Excel file, with data starting at **row 2**
- Columns:

| Column | Name                  | Notes                                |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A      | GO-ITEM               | GO number + item (format: ????######-###?#) |
| B      | ORACLE                | 7-digit number                       |
| C      | PART NUMBER           | Part to be picked                    |
| D      | QTY REQ               | Qty needed for BO                    |
| E-G    | AMO, SURPLUS, KB      | Qty expected in inventory            |
| H      | FLOW STATUS           | AWAITING_SHIPPING or BOOKED          |
| I      | REDCON STATUS         | From 1 (urgent) to 5 (not urgent)    |

### BO Integration Goals:
- On receiving, immediately allocate scanned parts to BO if match found
- Show GO-ITEM if relevant
- Update BO report at end of receiving session

## 12. NEXT STEPS
Let‚Äôs clarify step-by-step the following missing pieces:
1. ‚úÖ Authentication with login/password is required. User sessions must be tracked to associate actions with each user.
2. ‚úÖ Parts can be scanned multiple times as long as total does not exceed expected quantity. If exceeded, block scan and show visual/audio alert.
3. ‚úÖ Quantity defaults to 1. After each scan, it resets to 1. A numeric input option is preferred for flexibility, but the system must validate numeric input and block invalid values.
4. ‚úÖ When a part number appears on multiple lines (AMO + KANBAN), the system auto-allocates scans to AMO first, then KANBAN. The shipper does not need to choose.
5. ‚úÖ Scan summary should be saved in the DB (`scan_summary`) and exportable (e.g. CSV) at the end of each session. ADMIN can consult and re-export any session later.
