### Logs

Runtime logs are written to `tracker.log` in the project root. This file is
created automatically when the application starts.


## Workflow

Scanning progress is recorded continuously in the `scan_events` table as each barcode is processed. A summary row in `scan_summary` is only written when the user finishes a waybill or ends the session via the cleanup routine. If the application is terminated unexpectedly, only the `scan_events` entries remain and the summary may be missing.


## Importing Part Identifiers

Part identifiers map UPC barcodes to internal part numbers. They also allow the
system to apply a default quantity and store a short description for each UPC.

Administrators can load these mappings from a CSV file:

1. Open the **Admin** interface and switch to the **Waybill Upload** tab.
2. Click the **Import Part Identifiers** button and select your CSV file.
3. The file must contain the following column headers:
   - `part_number`
   - `upc_code`
   - `qty`
   - `description`
